  	MONIQUE RICO CINATL
</h1>

Hi!

My name is Monique Cinatl, and I am a front-end web developer. I have 7+ years of experience working in higher education, and I am eager to bring my strong organizational and communication skills, the ability to effectively problem solve and troubleshoot issues, and a demonstrated drive to succeed into a new career in tech.

I am recent Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript techdegree grad, and I am looking forward to a lifetime of continued learning. Take a look at my repositories to see some of the projects I have worked on throughout my techdegree journey. As a code newbie, I am eager to learn and improve, so if you have any feedback you could provide or know of any job opportunities, I would love to get in touch!

- Currently working on: freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Cerification
