Hi!

My name is Monique Cinatl, and I am an aspiring junior developer. I am currently working through Treehouse's Full Stack JavaScript techdegree, and am looking forward to a lifetime of continued learning! I have 7 years of experience working in higher education, and I am ready to bring my organization, problem-solving, collaboration, and communication skills into the tech world.

:sparkles: Also, because I am obsessed with them, here is my litte family --> :dog2: Riley, :cat: Finn, and :man: my hubby! These are my people.
