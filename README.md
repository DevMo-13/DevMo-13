Hi!

My name is Monique Cinatl, and I am an aspiring junior developer. I have 7 years of experience working in higher education, and I am ready to bring my organization, problem-solving, collaboration, and communication skills into the tech world. 

I am currently working through Treehouse's Full Stack JavaScript techdegree, and am looking forward to a lifetime of continued learning. Take a look at my repositories below to see some of the projects I have worked on throughout my techdegree journey. As a code newbie, I am eager to learn and improve, so if you have any feedback you could provide or know of any job opportunities, I would love to get in touch!

- Currently working on: Treehouse's FSJS Techdegree

- Next up: freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Cerification
